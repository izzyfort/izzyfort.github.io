     Hello! This is my introfuction to myself.

     My name is Izzy Forthaus, and I am a senior at Mizzou working towards my Bachelor’s degree in Health Sciences: Leadership and Policy as well as a minor in business and an IT certificate. I am not sure if I want to do healthcare administration, business, or health informatics, so I wanted to make sure I had all my bases covered in undergrad! This summer I am working as a manager at Andy’s Frozen Custard and interning at an assisted living facility. While I have no web application experience, I have experience coding in Python and C# and used VS Studio all last semester. From this course, I hope to gain a stronger understanding of the content I interact with online as well as the knowledge of how to create my own website. Even from the first lessons, I think this will be a very cool course that teaches me many useful digital skills that I can utilize in future courses. With these skills, I want to update the website of the assisted living facility I am working at and create a digital portfolio for myself for my upcoming job search. My favorite hobby is collecting records, though I mostly only collect country records. I love going to Hitt Street Records in Columbia with my friends to browse the vinyl stacks. In my free time, I go to the gym, watch funny TV shows, shop, do DIY crafts, and read. I’m excited for this summer semester!
