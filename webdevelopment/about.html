    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Izzy Forthaus, and I am currently pursuing a <em>Bachelor of Health Sciences with an emphasis in Leadership and Policy</em> at the University of Missouri. I’m part of the College of Health Sciences and plan to graduate in <strong>December 2025</strong>. In addition to my major, I am earning a minor in Business and a certificate in <em>Information Systems and Technology</em> to broaden my skills. <br />
      I am passionate about improving long-term care and committed to making a positive difference in the lives of older adults. My career goal is to become a nursing home administrator after graduation. Currently, I work as a manager at Andy’s Frozen Custard, where I am developing my leadership and operational skills. I also serve as an intern at Garden View Assisted Living Facility in Valley Park, gaining hands-on experience in senior care, healthcare operations, and facility management. This role has given me valuable insight into the challenges and rewards of healthcare leadership.
