      <p>Welcome to my Health Sciences Portfolio! I created this website to showcase the projects and skills I’ve developed as a student at the University of Missouri pursuing a career in healthcare administration.</p>

      <div class="about-text">
        <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase my academic and professional development as I prepare for a career in healthcare administration, with a focus on becoming a nursing home administrator. This portfolio highlights key projects that align with core health sciences competencies, including health education, health policy, and health promotion and design. My goal is to demonstrate how I’ve applied classroom learning to real-world experiences through internships, research, and organizational involvement. Each section reflects the growth of my knowledge and skills in healthcare systems, operations, and compassionate care. The main objective of this website is to clearly present my qualifications and share insight into my values as a future healthcare leader. It also serves to provide potential employers and graduate programs with evidence of my ability to make a positive impact in long-term care. Additionally, you’ll find my resume and a personal introduction to offer a well-rounded view of who I am professionally.</p>
